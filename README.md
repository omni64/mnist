# MNIST

## Current Features:
* Neural Net predicts handwritten digits from mnist dataset with 97% accuracy after 3 epochs. 


## Ideas :
* Create tool to write own handwritten digits, possibly with user input to verify
* Support for n-digit numbers
* Perform basic math operations
* Scan Sudoku images and implement [N-Dimensional Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/omnivore13/Python-Projects/blob/master/sudoku.py)
